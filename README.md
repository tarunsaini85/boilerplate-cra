* A **"READY to RUN"** application.

  

  

*  **Based on create-react-app** including react, redux, react-router, localforage(for indexedDB/webSQL/Localstorage), sass-loader, webpack, code-splitting/chunking, font-icons, jest and more.

  

  

*  **No-hassel** of creating the initial setup, installing huge list of modules, configuring and tuning them around.

  

  

*  **Just install and start developing** your project over it.

  

  

* As it is built over ejected create-react-app setup, everything can be **very easily customizable and configurable** so that you can add/remove modules, features, functionalities and manipulate configurations as per your project needs and **create your own customized setup out of it**.

  

  

  

## No-Fuss, ready to run application!

  

  

  

Just install it, run **"npm start"** and start developing your project.

  

  

  

  

## Installing and running your application

  

  

  

* Create your project directory and inside it run : **```npm i boilerplate-cra```**

  

  

  

* Inside your project directory run command **```npm start```**

  

  

* For production build run : **```npm run gen```** (you will see a gen directory containing all your deploy-able production code with all your chunks, font-icons etc.)

  

  

### *And there you are!! With a ready to use react application with everything(redux, router, code-splitting, data persistance/localstorage, font-icons, jest) already up and running!*

  

  

  

>Note: You may need to have ```create-react-app``` and ```serve``` installed globally before installing ```boilerplate-cra``` (if you want to play around with this setup...)

>Future: Working on upgrading webpack version from 3.x.x to 4.x.x. Will publish the ```Webpack-4``` version of ```boilerplate-cra``` soon.
